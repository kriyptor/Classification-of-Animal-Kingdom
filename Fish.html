<font color="silver" size="6"><ul>A fish is an animal which lives and breathes in water. 
All fish are vertebrates (have a backbone) and most breathe through gills and have fins and scales. 
Fish make up about half of all known vertebrate species. 
Fish have been on the earth for more than 500 million years
</ul>
<font color="silver" size="6"><ul>Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. 
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. 
Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.
</ul>
<font color="silver" size="6"><ul>Unlike mammals, fish are cold-blooded (ectothermic). 
This means that they do not maintain a constant internal body temperature; instead, their temperature is greatly influenced by their environment. 
True fish have a backbone and fins. Most also breathe with gills and have scales that cover their bodies.
